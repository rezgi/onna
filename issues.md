# Issues
Spotted issues and features that could be implemented in Godot

## AnimationPlayer

### Key Bindings
- go from keyframe to keyframe (j / k)
- add key (alt-clic for ex)
- duplicate key (select + ctrl-d)
- resize time (select all + alt-drag)
- space bar to play and stop
- alt + space to play backwards
- press 0 or Home to go to the beginning of the animation

### Enhancements
- add numeric input for easing value
- add easing property in right-clic menu
- different keyframe (kf) shapes according to easing type
- line between kf confusing for static, better for animation
- easing types library : save template
- add points to easing curve
- copy-paste keys between layers (maybe added, check)

---
## Misc.
- Lock layers in the editor
