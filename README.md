A first try in making a platform game in Godot

## ToDo

1. Make metronome * done, and solved latency bug by using 1 timer instead of 3
2. Metronome sends tempo data out * done
3. player receives tempo data * seems ok
4. player moves sync to tempo * WIP - works but jittery and don't understand all
5. player smooth movement (lerp)
6. make player input (keyboard UP/LEFT/RIGHT)
7. check player movement with tempo
